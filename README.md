# OpenJev

**Fast, calibrated, typed decisions from an open model.** OpenJev is an open-source
"System One" decision server. Send it a state and a set of typed questions (yes/no, choice,
score). It returns a probability and a confidence for every answer in tens of milliseconds.
It reads the answers straight off the model's probabilities. It generates no text and parses
nothing, so an answer cannot go off-schema. Questions can also ask about images.

OpenJev speaks the same wire API as TypeSafe's
[Jev](https://typesafe.ai/blog/introducing-system-one-models-and-jev), so their SDKs work
against it unchanged. It runs
[DiffusionGemma 26B-A4B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it-NVFP4)
(Apache-2.0) two ways: through vLLM on an NVIDIA GPU, or in-process through MLX on Apple
silicon. Both backends also serve text generation on an OpenAI-compatible
`/v1/chat/completions`, at no extra GPU memory.

OpenJev is an independent project. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by TypeSafe AI.

## Try it

```bash
pip install typesafe-sdk
export TYPESAFE_BASE_URL=https://api.codiv.ai   # or http://127.0.0.1:8080 for your own server
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=sk-codiv-...
```

```python
from typesafe_sdk import TypeSafeClient

client = TypeSafeClient()
r = client.system_one(
    "Everything is down and we have a demo with our biggest client at noon.",
    {
        "urgent": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Does the customer need a reply within the hour?"},
        "team":   {"type": "choice", "instructions": "Which team should handle it?",
                   "criteria": {"outage": "service down", "billing": "charges, refunds", "feature": "requests, how-to"}},
        "tone":   {"type": "score", "instructions": "How upset is the customer?",
                   "criteria": ["calm", "annoyed", "furious"]},
    },
)
r.nouls["urgent"].noul        # 1.00
r.choices["team"].choice      # "outage", confidence 1.00
r.scores["tone"].score        # 2.00 (expected level, 0-indexed)
```

Or with curl:

```bash
curl https://api.codiv.ai/v1/systemone \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TYPESAFE_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "openjev-latest", "state": "I was charged twice this month.",
       "questions": {"is_billing": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Is this a billing issue?"}}}'
```

## API

| | |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/systemone` | `{state, model, questions}` → `{model, answers, usage}` |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-style text generation with model `diffusiongemma-26b` ([below](#text-generation)) |
| `GET /v1/models` | `openjev-0.1` and its alias `openjev-latest`. The server also accepts `jev-latest` and `jev-preview`, so TypeSafe SDK defaults work. The list includes `diffusiongemma-26b`. |

Question types:

- **`noul`** (yes/no): takes optional `criteria: {true, false}` and returns `{noul: P(yes)}`.
- **`choice`**: takes `criteria: {name: description}` and returns `{choice, probabilities, confidence}`.
- **`score`**: takes `criteria: [level0, level1, …]` (2–10 levels) and returns `{score: Σ i·pᵢ, legend, probabilities, confidence}`.

`confidence` is `1 − H(p)/ln K`. It is 1 when the model is certain and 0 when the distribution
is uniform. `usage.input_tokens` counts prompt tokens, including image tokens.
`usage.output_tokens` is 0 unless you set `think` (below).

Errors follow the same shapes as Jev, checked against the live API:

- `422` with a FastAPI validation list for a field of the wrong shape.
- `400` with the reason as plain text for a question the server cannot ask (no options, too many
  options, or too many score levels).
- `400` `api_usage_error` for an unknown model or question type.
- `{"detail": {"error_type", "message"}}` for auth errors (`401`/`403`).
- `429` for rate limits, and `529` when the server is overloaded.

Known differences from Jev:

- Model names are OpenJev's own. `jev-latest` and `jev-preview` are aliases. A pinned Jev
  version such as `jev-1.13.0` answers `400` `Unknown model`.
- A choice with one option, or a score with one level, gets a direct answer (probability 1)
  with no read, so it bills no tokens. Jev returns the same values and bills for the read.
- A body nested a thousand levels deep answers `422`. Jev answers `500`.
- The server answers many questions in chunks of about 12 per read, still in parallel.

### Extensions

These optional request fields are OpenJev additions to Jev's contract. Leave them out and a
request behaves exactly like Jev. TypeSafe's SDKs never send them. They come from the example
server in vllm-project/vllm#57250.

| Field | Values | What it does | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `images` | up to 8 | Images the questions ask about, placed ahead of the state. Each is a `data:image/...;base64,` URL or `{"content_type", "base64"}`. JPEG, PNG, WebP or GIF, 5 MB each. | about 280 input tokens per image |
| `steps` | 1–8, default 1 | Denoise steps per read. More steps let the answers settle against each other. | same tokens, more GPU time |
| `samples` | 1–32 | Read N times with different noise and average. Replaces the automatic re-reads. | N × input tokens |
| `think` | 0–4096 tokens | The model writes a thought first, then reads the answers after it. The number is a hard cap. A thought that hits the cap gets cut off, so give multi-step problems 512 or more. | input tokens twice, plus the thought as output tokens |
| `sequential` | `true` | For long question lists answered in chunks: read the chunks in order. Each chunk sees the answers already chosen. | one read per chunk, run one after another |

```bash
curl https://api.codiv.ai/v1/systemone \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TYPESAFE_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "openjev-latest", "state": "Look at the photo.",
       "images": ["data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQ..."],
       "questions": {"hotdog": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "The photo shows a hot dog"}}}'
```

`think` and `sequential` need a text state, so you cannot combine them with `images`. Such a
request gets a 400.

### Text generation

`POST /v1/chat/completions` generates text with the same DiffusionGemma, OpenAI style. Tools
that talk to a chat model can point their base URL at OpenJev. Use model `diffusiongemma-26b`.
Both backends serve it, streaming and not, and a client cannot tell them apart except where
this section says so.

vLLM refuses some fields for diffusion models, so OpenJev adjusts requests instead of failing
them:

- It ignores `temperature`, `seed`, `min_p`, `logit_bias`, penalties and `reasoning`.
- `response_format` (`json_object` or `json_schema`) becomes an instruction to reply with JSON
  only. The server returns the first JSON object in the reply as the content.
- `max_tokens` defaults to 1024, with a cap of 8192. Thinking stays off unless you set
  `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": true}`. The thought then comes back separately in
  `message.reasoning`, never in `content`.
- `stream: true` streams server-sent events and always ends with a usage chunk.
- The endpoint supports tools (`tools`, `tool_choice`).

On MLX, three of these differ. `tools`, `tool_choice`, `logprobs` and `top_logprobs` are
accepted and ignored, not answered. A `stop` string that is more than one token is dropped,
because only a single token can end a denoised block. And there is no `message.reasoning`: the
model's thought channel is stripped from the reply, so `enable_thinking` changes the answer but
does not return the thought.

Generation denoises the output in 64-token blocks, so it costs far more GPU time than a System
One read. At most 8 generations run at once, so they never crowd out reads. On MLX the model
runs on one thread, so generations queue rather than overlap, and a client that disconnects
stops the reply at the next block instead of the next token.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="https://api.codiv.ai/v1", api_key="sk-codiv-...")
r = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="diffusiongemma-26b",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize: 3 nonstop flights, cheapest $212 on Delta."}],
)
print(r.choices[0].message.content)
```

## How it works

DiffusionGemma is a discrete diffusion model. It denoises a whole canvas of tokens per forward
pass instead of generating left to right. OpenJev uses that to read answers instead of writing
them.

It builds a canvas where the only masked tokens are the answer slots, one token per question:

```
canvas in                 one read-only pass         answer out
  q1: [?]        ──►      P(yes) 0.001        ──►    noul  0.001
  q2: [?]                 P(A) 0.000                 choice "billing"
                          P(B) 0.999                 confidence 0.997
                          P(C) 0.000
  q3: [?]                 P(0) 0.000                 score 1.00
                          P(1) 0.996
                          P(2) 0.004
```

Every label is a single token: `yes`/`no` for a `noul`, `A`/`B`/`C` for a choice, `0`/`1`/`2`
for a score. The model never writes into those slots. One read-only pass returns the
probability distribution over each slot, and that distribution **is** the answer. The numbers
above are a real read of "The invoice looks wrong again. Second time this quarter.": not
urgent, billing, mildly annoyed.

Two consequences follow. An answer cannot go off-schema, because the read scores only the label
tokens. And the confidence comes from the model's own distribution, not from a number the model
reports about itself.

If any slot is uncertain (entropy > 0.1), OpenJev re-reads with fresh noise up to four times
and averages the results. Question ids never reach the model: it sees `q1`, `q2`, `q3`.

The vLLM side of this is
[vllm-project/vllm#57250](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/57250), merged on 2026-09-22,
which adds seeded canvases, read-only steps, step caps and pinned canvas positions for
DiffusionGemma. `openjev/engine.py` is adapted from
that PR's `structured_server.py` example. It adds async I/O, bounded concurrency and
backpressure.

## Run your own

Two backends serve the same `/v1/systemone`. Pick by hardware:

| | vLLM (default) | MLX |
|---|---|---|
| Hardware | NVIDIA GPU, 24 GB or more | Apple silicon, about 16 GB free |
| Setup | Docker image | `pip install -e '.[mlx]'` |
| Reads | up to 64 in flight | one at a time |
| `images` | yes | yes |
| `steps` > 1 | yes | yes |
| `think` | yes | yes |
| Text generation | yes | yes, streaming included |

### NVIDIA GPU

You need an NVIDIA GPU with at least 24 GB of memory for the NVFP4 checkpoint (tested on an
RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell, sm_120).

A prebuilt image is on Docker Hub, so there is nothing to compile.
[`razorback16/openjev`](https://hub.docker.com/r/razorback16/openjev) runs vLLM's DiffusionGemma
structured reads (PR #57250) in one container with the Jev-compatible API server. It uses CUDA 13 and the
[pin below](#caveats).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/razorback16/openjev && cd openjev
docker compose up -d          # OpenJev on 127.0.0.1:8080 once the model has loaded
curl localhost:8080/v1/models
```

Or without compose:

```bash
docker run -d --gpus all --ipc=host -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
  -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface razorback16/openjev:0.4.0
```

The model weights (about 18 GB) download on first start into `~/.cache/huggingface`. Use
`docker compose build` to build the image yourself instead. vLLM listens only inside the
container. Set `OPENJEV_UPSTREAM` to skip it and use a vLLM server you already run.

Measured on an RTX PRO 6000 using 38% of the GPU, with 3 questions per request and cache-busted
states:

| Concurrency | req/s | p50 | p95 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 10.7 | 94 ms | 94 ms |
| 16 | 43.3 | 367 ms | 369 ms |
| 32 | 51.7 | 545 ms | 618 ms |
| 64 | 57.4 | 760 ms | 1109 ms |

Without Docker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm && cd vllm
git checkout 1b3b88ec2b7457aa030db4d0e7d8aaf04f6d0fb8   # the same commit the image pins
# a choice of more than 128 options needs the image's one-line cap change
sed -i 's/^MAX_LOGPROB_TOKEN_IDS = 128$/MAX_LOGPROB_TOKEN_IDS = 512/' vllm/sampling_params.py
VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 \
  VLLM_PRECOMPILED_WHEEL_COMMIT=1b3b88ec2b7457aa030db4d0e7d8aaf04f6d0fb8 pip install -e .
vllm serve nvidia/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it-NVFP4 --served-model-name dgemma \

  --async-scheduling --attention-backend TRITON_ATTN \
  --limit-mm-per-prompt '{"image": 8, "video": 0}' \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser gemma4 --reasoning-parser gemma4 \
  --override-generation-config '{"max_new_tokens": null}'
pip install -e path/to/openjev && python -m openjev
```

### Apple silicon

A Mac needs no vLLM and no Docker. `OPENJEV_BACKEND=mlx` runs DiffusionGemma inside the OpenJev
process through [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx) and
[mlx-vlm](https://github.com/Blaizzy/mlx-vlm). The 4-bit weights need about 16 GB of memory.

```bash
pip install -e '.[mlx]'
OPENJEV_BACKEND=mlx python -m openjev     # 127.0.0.1:8080
```

`/v1/systemone` answers reads with the same prompts, canvases and seeds as the vLLM backend,
including `images`, `samples`, `sequential`, `steps` and the automatic re-reads. Each denoise
step past the first reuses the one prefill of the prompt and writes back only the answer slots,
so the template cannot drift: more steps cost GPU time, not prompt tokens. On vLLM the same
holds because a multi-step read pins every canvas position but the answer slots. `think` writes the
thought with mlx-vlm's own denoise loop, then reads after it, and bills exactly as vLLM does.

An image read builds its prompt with the mlx-vlm processor, which expands each image into its
soft tokens. `usage.input_tokens` and `OPENJEV_MLX_MAX_PROMPT` both count that expanded prompt.
The server keeps the prefill of a recent prompt, so the re-reads and the `samples` of one
request share a single vision pass.

Reads run one at a time, so this backend suits local use rather than serving. A 3-question
request takes about 0.2–0.4 s on an M3 Ultra and about 0.39 s on an M4 Max, both with the 4-bit
weights. 16 concurrent requests finish at about 4 req/s.

```bash
OPENJEV_MLX_TEST_MODEL=path/to/weights pytest tests/test_mlx_model.py   # tests against the real model
```

### Settings

The server reads its settings from the environment.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENJEV_BACKEND` | `vllm` | `mlx` to run the model in-process on Apple silicon |
| `OPENJEV_UPSTREAM` | unset | external vLLM server URL. When set, the container does not start its own |
| `OPENJEV_MODEL` | `nvidia/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it-NVFP4` | weights the built-in vLLM serves |
| `OPENJEV_MLX_MODEL` | `mlx-community/diffusiongemma-26B-A4B-it-4bit` | MLX weights: a local directory or a Hugging Face id. Also supplies the tokenizer. `8bit` and `bf16` builds exist too. |
| `OPENJEV_MLX_MAX_PROMPT` | `32768` | longest request, in tokens, before a 400 |
| `OPENJEV_GPU_UTIL` | `0.9` | vLLM `--gpu-memory-utilization` |
| `OPENJEV_MAX_NUM_SEQS` | `64` | vLLM `--max-num-seqs` |
| `OPENJEV_MAX_MODEL_LEN` | `65536` | vLLM `--max-model-len` |
| `OPENJEV_VLLM_ARGS` | unset | extra `vllm serve` flags |
| `OPENJEV_CANVAS` | `64` | canvas length. Also sets the built-in vLLM's `--diffusion-config` |
| `OPENJEV_MAX_INFLIGHT` | `64` | reads in flight to vLLM |
| `OPENJEV_MAX_QUEUE` | `512` | waiting decisions before the server returns 529 |
| `OPENJEV_API_KEY` | unset | require `Authorization: Bearer <key>` |
| `OPENJEV_ORIGIN_SECRET` | unset | require an `X-Origin-Secret` header (for use behind a proxy) |
| `OPENJEV_MAX_IMAGES` | `8` | images per request. Also sets the built-in vLLM's `--limit-mm-per-prompt` |
| `OPENJEV_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` | `5242880` | size limit per image, after base64 decoding |
| `OPENJEV_GEN_MAX_INFLIGHT` | `8` | text generations running at once |
| `OPENJEV_GEN_MAX_QUEUE` | `32` | waiting generations before the server returns 529 |
| `OPENJEV_GEN_MAX_TOKENS` | `8192` | cap on `max_tokens` for text generation |
| `OPENJEV_WARMUP` | `1` | `0` skips the warmup requests sent before the API opens. They save the first users several seconds of compiling. |

## Caveats

- vllm-project/vllm#57250 merged on 2026-09-22, so this project now pins upstream vLLM at that
  merge commit rather than a fork. The image still makes one change to it: upstream allows 128
  exact label ids per request, and a 255-option choice needs more, so the build raises that cap
  to 512.
- The model's config asks for bidirectional attention inside each image
  (`use_bidirectional_attention: "vision"`), which vLLM's DiffusionGemma prefill does not yet
  apply. Image answers are still read from a causal prefill.
- Answer quality is the quality of DiffusionGemma 26B-A4B used in this mode. Evaluate it on your
  own tasks before you rely on it.
